# Human Monitoring Technologies - Health first of all!
## **Introduction**

The European Commission recently introduce the concept of Industry 5.0 [1] meaning a more "human-centric, resilient, and sustainable approach" for the design of industrial systems and operations. A deep understanding of the work environment and organization is thus fundamental to start analysing the working conditions and the resulting User eXperience (UX) of real operators. Also, the knowledge about users’ needs and ergonomics is fundamental to optimize the workers’ wellbeing, working conditions, and industrial results. The integration of the human-in-the-loop principle in modern productive systems and the introduction of new working paradigms where humans and machines cooperate interacting each other, reinforced the need of human-centric smart manufacturing (HSM). 
Moreover, the new advances in information technologies, such as the diffusion of cost-effective embedded systems with increasing computational power, big data, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as the wide spreading of the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) and Machine to Machine Communication (M2M) paradigms, cyber physical systems (CPSs) and digital twins, AR and VR devices gave a great impetus to such research.

## **Objective** 

This repository represents a place where to share and concretely implement human monitoring technologies (both hardware and software) for the factory of the future and beyond. AI, smart wearables sensors, improved human tracking algorithms, VR/AR, neural interfaces are just some of the main topics and today challenges: do not hesitate to share your ideas or propose new projects/technologies.
